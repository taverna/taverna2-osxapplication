OSX Application Glue Code
-------------------------

This library exists to act as a glue layer to the OSX native application
event system. It only correctly builds on OSX.

It was originally hosted in CVS on SourceForge at:
`:pserver:anonymous@taverna.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/taverna/osxapplication`
